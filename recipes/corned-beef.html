    <h2>What's more Irish than a traditional recipe for corned beef and cabbage? Serve with mustard or horseradish if desired.</h2>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (3 pound) corned beef brisket with spice packet</li>
        <li>10 small red potatoes</li>
        <li>5 medium carrots</li>
        <li>1 large head cabbage</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place corned beef in a Dutch oven and cover with water. Add spice packet, cover, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until corned beef is just about fork-tender, about 2 hours.</li>
        <li>While the corned beef is simmering, cut potatoes in half. Peel carrots and cut into 3-inch pieces. Cut cabbage into small wedges.</li>
        <li>When corned beef has cooked for 2 hours, add potatoes and carrots; cook until vegetables are almost tender and meat is fork-tender, about 10 minutes. Add cabbage and cook until tender, about 15 more minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove meat and let rest for 15 minutes. Leave broth and vegetables in the Dutch oven.</li>
        <li>Slice meat across the grain. Serve with vegetables and broth.</li>
    </ol>
